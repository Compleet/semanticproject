## Notes on Social Energy Management

At 68, I've learned to balance social commitments with personal energy. I love being connected and involved, but I also need quiet time to recharge. Robert is wonderful about helping me maintain this balance - he reminds me when I'm overcommitting and supports me in all my social activities.

The key is choosing activities that genuinely fulfill me rather than feeling obligated to say yes to everything. My family and close community connections bring me the most joy, while the creative and volunteer work feeds my sense of purpose.
