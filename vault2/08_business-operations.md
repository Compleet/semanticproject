## Notes

Robert helps tremendously with appointment scheduling and customer communication. He's become quite good at taking initial project details and helping customers feel welcomed.

The business is growing steadily, but I'm careful not to overbook. Quality work and happy customers are more important than maximum volume. Plus, I need energy for family and volunteer commitments!
