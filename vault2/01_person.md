## About Me

I'm a retired elementary school teacher who discovered my passion for sewing has turned into a thriving small business. After 35 years of teaching 3rd graders, I now spend my days creating custom clothing, doing alterations, and teaching sewing classes from my home studio.

My life is wonderfully busy with my sewing business, staying connected with my large extended family, volunteering at the community center, and my book club. I believe in staying active and engaged at every stage of life!
