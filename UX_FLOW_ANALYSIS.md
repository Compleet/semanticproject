**Power Users** (20% of market):

- Semantic addressing control
- Advanced search operators
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Customization options

### 3. **Leverage Unique Strengths**

- **Complexity Abstraction**: Market this heavily
- **Semantic Foundation**: Enable features others can't
- **Visual Knowledge**: Make graphs central to experience
- **Goal Integration**: Connect knowledge to outcomes

### 4. **Address Competition**

**vs Obsidian**: "Accessible complexity - no learning curve" **vs Notion**:
"True knowledge linking, not just databases" **vs Roam**: "Beautiful graphs that
work on mobile" **vs Logseq**: "Instant value without block-based thinking"
